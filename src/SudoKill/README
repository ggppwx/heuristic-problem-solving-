When connecting to the server as the client, send these to the socket:

SUDOKILL_PLAYER
print_your_name_here

When the game starts, the server will send the player to move a history of all moves with this format (where x,y of 0,0 corresponds to the upper left cell):

MOVE START
<x> <y> <num>
MOVE END

Example:

MOVE START
0 0 5
0 3 4
-1 -1 -1
4 3 8
MOVE END

A special move (-1, -1, -1) is a marker the separates moves that are part of the filled cells of the initial board and actual player moves. In other words, if (-1, -1, -1) was the last move, that means the current player was the first player.

The player should respond with a move with the same format without the start and end. Ex:

4 7 9

A sample client implementation player.rb is also available for reference. To run the script, type:

ruby player.rb <port> <name to use>

Note: the script assumes the server is located at localhost.

To run the server, go to the bin directory and type:

java nyu.hps.SudoKill <port> <# of cells to be filled on initial board>
